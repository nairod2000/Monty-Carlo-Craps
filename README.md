# Monty-Carlo-Craps
### What is a Monty Carlo Simulation?
A simulation to aquire the probability of getting a result in an
activity or game by running it many times. Then, the occurrence of the 
desired result is compared the total number of times it was run.

### This Game
This program is a Monty Carlo simulation of the game of craps.

It uses optimized vector-vector operations provided by numpy
to perform the simulation quickly in python.

Using the numpy.ndarray data structure allows for a speed up by an order of magnitue 
when doing one million examples
